## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is fundamental practice in which an automated test is written before the feature implementation, thus driving the API design, and encouraging SOLID principles. It has the secondary benefits of verifying that the implementation works, helping the code base communicate intent and providing a regression test suite for safe refactoring.

## Proficiencies

<details>
<summary><b> Intermediate </b></summary>

An intermediate software craftsperson…

- Habitually uses TDD when developing software
- Strives to write tests that are simple, maintainable, robust and communicate intent, but may not always succeed
- Writes integration tests to assert interactions with common backing services (other services, databases, file systems, etc)
- Avoids common TDD pitfalls
- May rely too heavily on mock objects / spies, resulting in overly brittle tests and higher maintenance
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced</b> </summary>

In addition, an advanced software craftsperson…

- Strives to keep the TDD cadence fast
- Consistently writes tests that are simple, maintainable, robust and communicate intent
- Writes integration tests to assert interactions with less common backing services (e.g. message brokers, ftp servers) and for complex scenarios (e.g. those involving time zones, inherent randomness, concurrency, etc)
- Critically evaluates and champions worthwhile testing tools
- Supports less proficient software engineers with TDD
- Encourages TDD within their team
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Expert</b> </summary>

An expert software craftsperson…

- Knows when to break the rules
- Encourages TDD beyond their team
- Contributes to the TDD body of work through articles, public speaking, open source, etc
</details>
