## What Should I Expect ?

Your learning is divided into Units covering the various skills which have been identified as valuable for Haven.

These units span four [proficiency levels](#proficiency) from Beginner to Expert, and each will contain one or more Modules which focus on a specific aspect for the skill in question; For example, the 'Craft' Unit contains four modules concerning programming best practices which include: Test Driven Development, Clean Code, and Production Readiness.

When learning [skills](#skills) it is improtant to realise they are not straight forward, it may take the combination of several modules to master a single skill.

The learning will be a mix of on-the-job experience and your own research. This means you will not be stuck in a classroom environment, instead you will be implementing real code on real projects! The benefit of this is the experience you can leverage from your colleagues via questioning implementations and direct feedback on your own code.

Depending on how much you already know, this might sound terrifying! (it was for me!); Just remember: When you are learning something new, forgetting how to do it is expected and normal.

## Module Structure

Each module is divided into three sections designed to introduce you to various concepts and spread your learning over bite-sized chunks. In some cases the modules will provide you with some starter knowledge while others expect you to source your own research; However, in these cases the modules will still point you in the right direction.

Every module will give you learning outcomes and provide some [resources](#resources) to help you achieve them.

At the end of each section you will be prompted to review the aspects you have learned and write about them, but you should take notes throughout as you progress within each module.

## How Should I Learn ?

Writing up is an effective method to help you process and make sense of everything you have learned throughout the day. In many cases it helps you to make connections between topics; for example, the connections between two seemingly separate processes such as creating automated tests and confidence your code is production ready.

Live or Bullet Journals are also a great method to abstract your knowledge into a form unique to your own ability to understand and process information. They can help you to create methods to remember, and to set your own targets for aspects you want to learn more about.

For more information about live journals and effective note taking read about The Cornell Note Taking Method or see the following links:

- [Effective Note Taking Methods](https://www.oxfordlearning.com/5-effective-note-taking-methods/)
- [How to Start a Bullet Journal](https://alovelyyear.com/start-bullet-journal/)

Most of all, ask lots of questions! It's great to know how to do something; it's better to understand why.

## Skills and Seniority

Seniority reflects an engineer’s effectiveness at problem solving within a specific context.

After learning the ropes, a Junior Engineer is effective at solving well-defined, self-contained problems by following a series of prescribed low-level steps. A Mid-Level Engineer is effective at solving less well defined, less contained and more complex problems, with high level guidance. A Senior Engineer is effective at solving undefined, unconstrained, and complex problems from both a technical and non-technical perspectives.

Technical skills are important, but not sufficient by themselves; Behaviour, Approach, and Wisdom play a critical part in determining someone’s seniority.

## Skills

Skills are not straight forward. They can be:

- **Composable**  
  Someone who is skilled with relational databases is so because they are skilled in SQL, data modelling and optimisation
- **Related**  
  Someone who is skilled in JavaScript will find TypeScript familiar
- **Context dependent**  
  An engineer on the Search squad needs Elasticsearch, but an engineer on the Checkout squad does not
- **Time dependent**  
  The relevance and need for skills may change over time. Consequently, some of the skills you have spent time acquiring may become redundant

## Proficiency

We use the following levels to categorise proficiency:

1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced
4. Expert

You start at level 1 with no expectation for knowledge within any of the skills. Each skill description specifies the entry level criteria for meeting the levels of proficiency. Not all skills are complex enough to require all levels, and some skills have a practical cut-off point beyond which additional expertise has little benefit to Haven.

## Resources

Each skill description includes a set of links to relevant resources and may include the Pluralsight training platform and/or books. If you do not have Pluralsight account, speak to your Head of Engineering. All books referenced in this document can be expensed.

Where articles are referenced, they may be highly opinionated or controversial. Their inclusion is not intended to advocate for an extreme position, merely to provide balance and alternative viewpoints.

Where tools/libraries/frameworks are referenced (especially those developed by [yours truly](https://github.com/cressie176)), the intention is provide a wider understanding of the body of work, and in some cases, to highlight problems with more popular alternatives. It is not the intention to advocate that a specific tool be adopted.
