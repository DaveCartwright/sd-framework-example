## What Should I Expect ?

Your learning is divided into Units covering the various skills which have been identified as valuable for Haven.

These units span four [proficiency levels](appendix.md#proficiency) from Beginner to Expert, and each will contain one or more Modules which focus on a specific aspect for the skill in question; For example, the 'Craft' Unit contains four modules concerning programming best practices which include: Test Driven Development, Clean Code, and Production Readiness.

When learning [skills](appendix.md#skills) it is improtant to realise they are not straight forward, it may take the combination of several modules to master a single skill.

The learning will be a mix of on-the-job experience and your own research. This means you will not be stuck in a classroom environment, instead you will be implementing real code on real projects! The benefit of this is the experience you can leverage from your colleagues via questioning implementations and direct feedback on your own code.

Depending on how much you already know, this might sound terrifying! (it was for me!); Just remember: When you are learning something new, forgetting how to do it is expected and normal.

## Module Structure

Each module is divided into three sections designed to introduce you to various concepts and spread your learning over bite-sized chunks. In some cases the modules will provide you with some starter knowledge while others expect you to source your own research; However, in these cases the modules will still point you in the right direction.

Every module will give you learning outcomes and provide some [resources](#resources) to help you achieve them.

At the end of each section you will be prompted to review the aspects you have learned and write about them, but you should take notes throughout as you progress within each module.

## How Should I Learn ?

Writing up is an effective method to help you process and make sense of everything you have learned throughout the day. In many cases it helps you to make connections between topics; for example, the connections between two seemingly separate processes such as creating automated tests and confidence your code is production ready.

Live or Bullet Journals are also a great method to abstract your knowledge into a form unique to your own ability to understand and process information. They can help you to create methods to remember, and to set your own targets for aspects you want to learn more about.

For more information about live journals and effective note taking read about The Cornell Note Taking Method or see the following links:

- [Effective Note Taking Methods](https://www.oxfordlearning.com/5-effective-note-taking-methods/)
- [How to Start a Bullet Journal](https://alovelyyear.com/start-bullet-journal/)

Most of all, ask lots of questions! It's great to know how to do something; it's better to understand why.

> **Think harder about this. Journalling is good, but I think being tech, cloning this repo and pushing learning up to the various units is more appropriate, plus it provides hidden learning in the form of using git and repo organisation.**
>
> **Journals can be pushed, or just use MD and add image/miro etc where required.**
>
> **This could form a 'How to use thisGuide' section?**

## Skills and Seniority

Seniority reflects an engineer’s effectiveness at problem solving within a specific context.

After learning the ropes, a Junior Engineer is effective at solving well-defined, self-contained problems by following a series of prescribed low-level steps. A Mid-Level Engineer is effective at solving less well defined, less contained and more complex problems, with high level guidance. A Senior Engineer is effective at solving undefined, unconstrained, and complex problems from both a technical and non-technical perspectives.

Technical skills are important, but not sufficient by themselves; Behaviour, Approach, and Wisdom play a critical part in determining someone’s seniority.

## Next Step... Are you ready Player One?

need to reference how to use this, ie its modular, any order, can do advanced JS before intermediate SNS etc.
