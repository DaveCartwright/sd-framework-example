# Appendix

## Skills

Skills are not straight forward. They can be:

- **Composable**  
  Someone who is skilled with relational databases is so because they are skilled in SQL, data modelling and optimisation
- **Related**  
  Someone who is skilled in JavaScript will find TypeScript familiar
- **Context dependent**  
  An engineer on the Search squad needs Elasticsearch, but an engineer on the Checkout squad does not
- **Time dependent**  
  The relevance and need for skills may change over time. Consequently, some of the skills you have spent time acquiring may become redundant

## Proficiency

We use the following levels to categorise proficiency:

1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced
4. Expert

You start at level 1 with no expectation for knowledge within any of the skills. Each skill description specifies the entry level criteria for meeting the levels of proficiency. Not all skills are complex enough to require all levels, and some skills have a practical cut-off point beyond which additional expertise has little benefit to Haven.

## Resources

Each skill description includes a set of links to relevant resources and may include the Pluralsight training platform and/or books. If you do not have Pluralsight account, speak to your Head of Engineering. All books referenced in this document can be expensed.

Where articles are referenced, they may be highly opinionated or controversial. Their inclusion is not intended to advocate for an extreme position, merely to provide balance and alternative viewpoints.

Where tools/libraries/frameworks are referenced (especially those developed by [yours truly](https://github.com/cressie176)), the intention is provide a wider understanding of the body of work, and in some cases, to highlight problems with more popular alternatives. It is not the intention to advocate that a specific tool be adopted.
